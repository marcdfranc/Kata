## Tip

I Have implemented a simple page that I put in web directory to interact with the dotnet API.

### to make it works

1. Clone the project and run it.
2. You should to fill the variabel ***"BASE_URL"*** with the base url of API in the html file, look the example bellow.
```hrml
<head>
		 <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>
		 <script>
			var BASE_URL = "https://localhost:44300";
		 </script>
	</head>
```

3. Execute the html file in your browser and enjoy.
